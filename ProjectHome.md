The aim of this project is to provide an Eclipse plug-in that allows scrolling with middle mouse button (like in popular browsers).

Current version supports scrolling only in text editors. It's hard to add scrolling in other elements, as each type of viewer or editor must be hacked in unique way. Anyway, scrolling for other popular workbench parts should be added in future versions.

Plug-in works with Eclipse 3.2 or later. Tested only on win32 platform (let me know how it works if you use it on other platforms).
